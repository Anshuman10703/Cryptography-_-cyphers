Project Overview

This project implements classical cryptographic techniques using Java, focusing on the Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher. 
It includes:
Encryption and decryption functions for both ciphers.

A method to break the Caesar Cipher using frequency analysis.
A cryptanalysis method to break the Vigenère Cipher using the Kasiski examination technique and frequency analysis.
The project demonstrates both theoretical knowledge of cryptography and practical Java programming skills.

Features
Caesar Cipher:
Encrypts and decrypts messages by shifting characters of the alphabet.
Provides an algorithm to break the Caesar Cipher using letter frequency analysis.

Vigenère Cipher:
Encrypts and decrypts messages using a keyword for multiple shifts of the alphabet.
Offers functionality to break the Vigenère Cipher using known cryptographic analysis techniques.

Cryptanalysis:
Implements basic cryptanalysis tools such as letter frequency comparison and the Kasiski method.
